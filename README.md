# 🎯 Spotlify - Your AI-Powered Career Assistant
> **About the name:** SPOT is the name of my website (https://sparshhurkat.vercel.app/), and this project is inspired by "simplify" — hence **Spotlify** (SPOT + simplify). No relation to Spotify, but I wish that wasn't taken XD

**Spotlify** is an intelligent career assistant that helps you craft the perfect resume, write compelling cover letters, and ace application questions using AI-powered RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) technology.
